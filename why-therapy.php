					<h1>Why Therapy</h1>
					<p class="section-callout">When all is well, people usually rely on support from family, friends and co-workers to help them get through hard times.</p>
					<p>But there are times when those supporters are unavailable, busy, or too close to the problem themselves to help. Sometimes usual supporters are the source of distress. And sometimes you’re feeling poorly enough or the challenge is great enough that you just need a little extra help.</p>
					<h2>What is Therapy For?</h2>
					<p>Therapy is a way to supplement the support system you already have. Meeting with a skillful therapist who is there just for you is one of the best gifts you can give yourself.</p>
					<h2>What Makes Therapists Skillful?</h2>
					<p>Therapists are professionally trained and licensed. They respect your privacy. They ask good questions and help you make sense of why you may be feeling the way you feel. They support you as you make important choices or decisions. Good therapists don’t give unsolicited advice or tell you that you are right or wrong.</p>
					<p>Instead, they offer you the time, space, and guidance to sort out your thoughts and feelings, clarify what’s important to you, and relieve emotional pain. Therapists help you feel hopeful again.</p>
					<h2>What Kinds of Problems Can Therapy Help With?</h2>
