					<p>The best approach in therapy is the approach that works for you. You know yourself better than anyone else – but during stressful times it’s easy to lose your bearings and feel at sea. It’s not uncommon for a person to come to therapy without a clear sense of their goals – they just know that something needs to change. When you come to see me, we’ll start wherever you are and help you get back to feeling like yourself again.</p>

					<p>I draw on several approaches to therapy, all of which have been shown to reduce stress and help people gain clarity and make changes in their lives. They include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.actmindfully.com.au/acceptance_&_commitment_therapy">Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.beckinstitute.org/get-informed/cbt-faqs/">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://behavioraltech.org/resources/whatisdbt.cfm">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT)</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress-reduction/faqs/">Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)</a></li>
						<li><a href=" http://www.motivationalinterviewing.org/">Motivational Interviewing (MI)</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>Because therapy is an investment of your time, money, and energy, I am careful to keep therapy focused on your goals and progress. We also regularly assess how our work together is going and make adjustments as needed.</p>

					<p>Talking with a therapist – or <span class="paragraph-callout">talk therapy</span> – has helped many people manage personal challenges, big and small. Therapists are learning that there are other approaches to help people that go beyond just talking. Simple exercises that quiet the mind and body and make it easier to express difficult feelings can be very helpful too.</p>
					<p>Often referred to as <span class="paragraph-callout">Mindfulness</span>, some of these exercises help us pay closer attention to thoughts, feelings, and sensations that we don’t normally notice.  Mindfulness exercises bring clarity and calm and help people cope better with painful feelings. While talk therapy is especially good at helping us think differently mindfulness is great at helping us experience things differently.</p>
					<p><span class="paragraph-callout">Art and writing</span> can be useful tools during therapy.  After all, emotions are often difficult to talk about. When you’re at a loss for words, using simple art-based exercises can help you express what language can’t. The best part is that curiosity is all you need - you don’t have to have any artistic talent or experience to benefit from these exercises!</p>
